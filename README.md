Mobile App Development



Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?




Weight. Launch Plan

  The app I chose to create is a weight tracking app with a minimalistic design. The app is called "Weight." and does not distract the user from their everyday life. This app allows the user to spend less time on their phone and makes sure the user does not experience distractions from their life due to encompassing a minimalistic design. The user can log weights efficiently and quickly so that they can get back to doing what they love. 
  The launch plan will also be efficient and minimalistic. Weight. will have a short description. This will convey to the user what kind of app they are looking at. It will say, “Track weights efficiently and get back to your life. Keeping track doesn’t have to be hard.” I think the description tells the user what the app is for and also let’s them know that there will be no distractions, ads, or addicting aspects to the app when they download it. They get a sense that the developers and designers what this user to love their app which doesn’t include being glued to a screen all day. The play store icon will be very simple. The icon will actually have a black background just like all backgrounds in the app. The "W." on the icone will be white. It will have the thin white outline that all buttons in the Weight. app have. 
  The specifications for this app are as follows: Android 14, API level 34, and will allow for API level 21. This range will work well for this app because it has simple functionality and design. Users with older phones can enjoy the app just like users on a Pixel 9 can. The updates for this app will simply be for security since no changes will need to be made to the app due to its simplicity. The future versions of the app probably won’t need a lot of work due to the simple framework of this app. Permissions are required for this app to work. The user is asked whether SMS notifications are allowed right after logging into the app initially or creating a new account. These permissions are: send SMS, receive SMS, read SMS, and telephony. These requests allow the app the function properly on android phones. 
  Weight. will have no ads. The app will cost the users in a subscription fee in the Play store. They can choose how they want to pay according to the Play store’s requirements. They can choose to pay monthly or yearly. I think the app will be a very helpful app to have downloaded on their phone and many will enjoy using it. Ultimately, allowing users to really enjoy their lives away from digital screens is the ultimate payment for this developer and designer.
